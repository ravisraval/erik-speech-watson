because this is Logan remote MIT 
good how are you 
you can hear your 
interested 
yeah I think you're taking the time to talk to me to ensure you're very busy 
it's not too inconvenient 
but I had 
while here 
well this is gonna miss me to enter 
yes Sir I guess but a before %HESITATION 
dive in give you a context like I I think that you know such as into the email there's that little paragraph just kind of describing %HESITATION generally what might these topics about 
I'm just looking at how workforce development and The Boston metro area is or is not %HESITATION aligning with you know environmental objectives are missile climate action plans so just kind of try to figure out what's been happening in the green workforce development or green jobs space in the past decade or so I'm gonna post a are a scam seem like help finding work collaboration 
stop door continued of that make sense 
%HESITATION 
so 
I don't have a whole lot of the background in workforce development should be really great if you guys could just kind of you know spell things out for me %HESITATION as we go through this 
and 
additionally I am I don't know if you saw in the email would be okay if I recorded this and everything will be anonymous or would you guess rather I didn't record 
I think it quite well great great 
yeah so basically be it because you just kind of give a little of your background like how long have you guys been working at the mass you see you know what kind of work to do before coming there how did you get your positions now 
Jamie little little introduction or background the great 
so 
eighteen actually act next year today 
they 
yeah yeah yeah 
so prior to coming here I would eat executive director 
after portal which is I don't think that you know labor and looks like about it 
he leaned 
writing our feet 
and the car came about after two thousand eight I believe the American 
covering act when the economy it kind of change 
yeah gate 
you know I wish around at green jobs you know 
so I had started working on 
that we got beat time actually and so you know working and getting that program and then eventually trying trying to beat each one that director what about 
laughter so you know right basically my background like I've been during work worked out for very long and because you know I've always work with you know low income generation 
but I'm getting out my career I caught you like I'll be the education research huge 
English are back in another language 
right coming over here and they want to get a job but they have to learn 
you know crazy language called English word 
so 
like I've been doing it for awhile now 
I can 
so my background is I had 
or I 
or act 
and before I was at the start of a new book on %HESITATION devaluation I'll 
for development and commercial development residential 
where did all this software assessment tool people you put their address we could catch whether that location is good for soul are not and it rolled out a company wide level of all that building location 
so they really got me interested in the latter there at your bank coming up to me was that I can start your order the general goal over time done away to workforce development I have been working with that because 
about three years now 
yeah we did manage to write a program that we 
all right here at the state are reading our internship program 
they got a different program 
yeah or people caloric background or your call 
show in case your weight in exposing them to clean energy and 
industry and get excited about technology yeah yeah that's great thank you for sharing that 
so that's actually perfect segue was going to ask you guys next on it you get kind of describe us in these initiatives so here's your name upside with what you just mentioned %HESITATION city we have some high school programs on it is the successful and clean energy program as well internship program so I was hoping you guys good in it and I don't have much of the work force on background so the the more you can explain for me better %HESITATION can has described like the structure of those programs like it sounds like the emphasis is really on spliced side 
labor development recess that's true okay yeah so can you just tell me like what do you like how long is programs run like how many people are you putting through %HESITATION at once like what is sort of the the career pathway or or apprenticeship partnerships you might set up I'm just really you know kind of holistically how how do you go about structuring these and number that look like 
yeah I think he is going to start off with it internship are going to go through what I want idea I think the internship program is probably our most 
well now a recognizable program it started in twenty eleven and it's really a summer program at eight hundred nineteen I think 
that first summer at creating employers and then off to be a program that runs around it exception 
and up last year played by water 
aiming to top six hundred that year after year 
so what day is it 
you think that our special 
example 
he will open up a little bit about your mother or the National Guard 
I wish all starting up today and that Iraq made group yet August 
and I'll I'll work to be essentially service 
we have an online portal where you can put their application 
and that we could agree get out in the database about 
nobody that show up late 
and that 
and likewise employers all the applications that we we already the application they already 
employers began to look at their job description that make sure that actually clean energy company integrated air internet 
we are out there working the reimbursement 
though they would pay that 
and at the end of the session 
and he wears are able to take on at least bill opted to enter they could take out their entire IT after international 
and it just are kind of advertising include that population in program get worked out 
they were always 
and that we have a wide variety of different role start off more engineering heavy but that you know the corporate way all business majors 
major 
%HESITATION employers I'd say I think 
where is that we played enters with our employees 
and like ninety five percent are here that if the employee though it's not really a very small %HESITATION 
all he had to work with and help them because they can search you dearest the hiring process lobby are growing may use our program 
in a particular session at their graduate or will graduate technically help keep them on her or part time role 
really help he employers find talent from the university here area and statewide 
god help build a company over time 
yeah yeah since grade 
so it is a question about that %HESITATION 
so you said that you would have like a vetting process to make sure these are actually clean energy companies 
just wondering what you have actually clean energy Lisa my mind can mean a lot of things you can mean 
like energy efficiency for buildings weather's ation solar panel installation or mystical constructions like you know I think it's kind of it could be broadly interpreted so what is a what do you guys looking for with your betting process like a re talking specifically about companies that are related just to energy or what like what is the criteria 
yeah I think so 
yeah it 
we pay it close to our mandate 
we can't 
essentially what we are designed to do it support for the industry that revolved 
you are correct SP also water technology so any concrete at doing %HESITATION universal energy 
a real way technology or supporting the 
where are their primary focus 
%HESITATION would qualify so they're all our technology work don't waste water mediation 
also do not support 
you know the oil and gas industry so this kind of online their work that well we wanna make sure that we're supporting companies are helping traditional way gaps are also fuel and so make sure not to wake up that are helping to make those technologies or 
%HESITATION and cheaper to use that we want to try it is focused primarily on okay I'll be there at all with 
yeah 
shit like older women hydro by all that for energy efficient though can be copied there design software to help building you know %HESITATION increased automation your reduce energy usage ballet the way you are you allow it 
Dr operate that works to 
yeah where Robert also your discretion company trying 
head of the program but there are really clean out your name 
really I'm working on that website asking that okay will they have any connection 
yeah at all 
trying to get your letter so do I I reach out 
that you get for you 
you know please 
apply in the future if you're doing 
if your company specifically are 
but yeah the time we're not able to provide you with an intern so really would require only get your application as it is to copy that or you know will check all my other what do they do every their job description will also 
make sure they're registered in your business 
and then lastly okay make sure that yet you agree to pay your 
yeah makes no sense sounds like the transition to low carbon economy away from fossil fuels Dougherty makes sense 
%HESITATION so one thing that I've been 
trying to puzzle out any guest touch on a little bit is 
the partnerships with community colleges or other organizations 
so like I I'm from California and soon near where I grew up it there's missile government and then there's the county government state and so the counties of kind of been involved in facilitating regional collaboration or or getting that dialogue between cities in organizations 
it doesn't seem like it's the same over here you know there's there's no accounting so 
to hear how these partnerships or clobbered efforts with community colleges or missile governments or indecent players like is there an organization aside from Massey see the Celtics this do you guys have employed employees that are designated just to our reach shore facilitating communication or anyhow to these partnerships kinda kind of form and stable as 
really yeah it came here that takes a lot out of it 
and I guess for lack of a better term data developed so you know if we're all the programs 
thank you ecology really are you get out there all relationships are out 
and all we try to go to the bank career and 
state university you know about the program or other program 
we try to make connections with the creatures are 
at each school got out of there we also you know will try to make sure that 
where appropriate I'll 
you know 
hold out for other programs 
wait 
yeah pocket all the gold but she had her copulation of all the different school of law 
seven eight do their number helpful truck you understand where the other organizations are they're operating date and then be able work with that whether it union or a college or you know what your organization 
it's not really you make sure that we're all 
if you think that rich job 
hello go out of our personal relationship 
and you know I think 
the programs are successful because a lot of dialogue with 
yeah 
makes sense 
okay so 
going backwards a little bit 
you mentioned the internship program on can you describe some of the other programs that you work on as well or that you have the ships 
surely 
I wear a year round program where we give them training around 
and then 
thank you hands on learning out like that technology or 
and they're running out 
%HESITATION you know whether it be writing rejection they'll work with others getting out of communicating aren't 
and they could be building out you know 
that it could 
each other 
news of the the this is the learning or an initiative 
yeah yeah yeah zoos that are primarily targeting of at risk youth or low income students or is this just available to all high schoolers 
I'll 
you know usually it's time to get where I wanted 
oh yeah and soon when you're developing this this initiative so 
in a curriculum for high school students or I think one of you mentioned a kid eight or maybe I just read that somewhere 
how exactly are you like I'm searching out for his question 
are you working with like state 
educational board educational standards to sort of shift their curriculum or print like have them develop curriculum that is more in line with 
it is projected to be regional economic needs or is it more you're just trying to make students aware of you know environmental considerations clean energy %HESITATION little energy technology things of that nature like is it is it's kind of like making them aware of 
how important climate changes or you actually trying to shift the school curriculum towards a burgeoning cannot call me sector in Massachusetts 
and it 
because the teachers that are part of the program the art teacher in high school contracting out your brain 
a lot of it in yeah rather actually because you know what I can't get your teammate that came in and and that that is focused on you know in that should be out of that you know each grade after it happened you know act but we get great 
eight happening exactly though 
yeah 
and yeah 
all of that that waiting on the map 
I saw it in there that 
it was 
and I RC yeah 
yeah we %HESITATION 
right back where it comes out account are all great make sure that we're sort of 
staying in line with what is the best practice sorry 
sure there were no exchange today 
yeah yeah cool 
mmhm okay and says 
going back to the scale of what you guys are working so Massey's he is operating properly at the state level right you guys work a lot governor and state government 
when you're trying to implement these programs or be a reach out to these communicable disease and in schools %HESITATION 
is it 
are the subject of phrases 
is the way the extractions programs or the out reach 
does it vary based on misspell your are based on the region like you know if you're if you're talking just to schools or clients are employers in Boston for example imagine conversations pretty different than for people maybe a little or a rally actually actually not right 
you know it when I don't we don't operate in a regional we operate out of date 
I mean I statewide approach because we are so 
if something is going to happen and then 
you know I thought they might be having the same problem but you know general request or go away only 
there are quite critical look at what your job right and then they 
not only you know your height 
you tell us what your problem is the one you want to attract but we don't go out there to date and your regional 
our mandate program how they want to run it by now 
we have to have it at the end of the war 
you know what will 
okay 
that's good enough 
how much regional or how much the interaction would you say you have with 
regional or local planning a workforce of authorization to give your operating that's the state level in the city you're having conversations with people theirs was a tell you we know what their needs are like how often is that happening would you say 
Michael that we are 
so you know what 
you know after warning touch point where that going across the state we do work without work for employers 
our admission 
the general location we 
you can you know get it you know reading writing and 
you know what right around that you know that you know 
after all I 
so 
depending on that again lying on the initiative back when it hit you know barely gore the region you know and say you know are you going to acquire a lot you know leave application to come in and then we'll look at it that way but not much where are you getting out 
you know that we 
in that day and age of technology right email that goes out 
and then if they want to buy their life they don't they don't buy it it definitely we'd all its regional when they want when they want out 
something that we are you know making a change 
and I think that they are at it about 
if I get back to the states at what you get talk out there when we're out at 
you know 
he asked as 
another call 
state where they lost to try our best to interact and let other people though 
but we're happy hat 
some of our 
at 
well we started to do it really make sure that you know if you're going to be awarded by at your your part to help 
that suggests that your program yelled get the word out a little bit whether they're holding local media or 
they're all of the people to be aware that there is working god help promote %HESITATION 
clean energy 
you're out yeah yeah school said Janet just educational factor here cool 
removal 
to 
one thing I've been reading a lot is a 
yeah I saw the the Massey see like a whole industry reports and it seems like nothing's wrong was going really great number one energy efficiency state %HESITATION increasing number of clean energy jobs I think in the two thousand sixteen wanted said that on the increase in employment 
just high school agrees or maybe just associates it seems like everything's going pretty well 
so things can always been my mind go better right so I'm wondering if you guys have any comments on 
just challenges you had wings program since he would like to have seen done differently maybe state policies that haven't worked out the way that you thought that they would or that he would like to change 
in any struggles are challenges yes Pat and promoting these %HESITATION clean energy or work for small programs 
yeah you know what a challenge that we 
you know every day it and I legislation we are quiet do you know what would have happened without any programming and that you 
you know below poverty level 
and and you know it you know operation several barriers to entry for employment 
and whether it could be Corey track 
get your route 
are you know educational why you know they graduate from high school with me to that level the only happened eight eight meeting level but I think you know we struggle with that of you know having 
something that we care deeply about but also how to that right program that will drag you know don't 
population that have a lot of 
entry 
because in our field yeah you know as you mentioned in the report 
entry level jobs are you know are doing well in New York get work that out 
but get a lot of 
general 
so you don't have that skill meeting Gil really you know why are you even going to go entry level job and not just the map reading don't matter work well with others 
guilt that day you know how to talk to me work with others 
I think we drove it back you know making sure that the population you know not just have you know 
we talked awhile and then you have the location and get those job you know how can we help them with their 
well because you know you have the ocean 
anymore you know if you're 
that's great you get that job okay although you know 
where do you know how to communicate are the challenges that beat in our struggle 
I think that I think that 
what 
you know we struggle with yeah I think she did 
I I realize that the only thing is I want to give it a concrete example it internship program 
it out over time that well it's like technically 
okay shoe any employer doing graduate work at eight 
we find that 
over time you know it's really serving that where you know it focusing on a lot of people deterrent for your degree at school you are acting in college 
so it doesn't really Shania 
locational high school element of 
for doing more work in the trades and we don't have as many employers that are doing that work though right now it had acted 
to rectify that dilution of that at though whether that program 
really fine what's working what's not working make sure over time that you're always touching a pact with Goldar whether it's not like you know Khalkhal our goal here but how can I stay on track and be aware of the art 
let's get the Nixons 
so I think one of one of the minor Chechens or their authorized by Mister %HESITATION so with heat with these internship programs or these types of property programs and you're you're getting people into entry level positions what kind of work are you guys doing to make sure that there are viable career pathways or room for advancement for these employees is the emphasis mostly on getting people into the industry and getting the first job or is it really important is that emphasis of the program also making sure that there is 
no room for growth %HESITATION within these these positions or these programs that you're setting up 
yeah I mean I think that we do that you know showing our team talk about apple credential 
I think that you know you 
I went into a job you know in the training you want to make sure that it will you know like we made sure that 
get out your little kid had training they had failed training that they were able to get it training credential and so you know I'm not 
%HESITATION credential using already back with another one that we 
anything that we look at court even without high school program well you know we're looking at 
it's going to get you know apprenticeship 
credit for what you what credential that thinking jacket on yet you get him into the entry level jobs but what what what doctor to get down to %HESITATION that quite well yet you're always looking for a show that can be stacked and you get them in here %HESITATION enacted very bad while I you know I think what I internship program 
you know I can't bother 
about getting that credential it's about 
right something where they getting hit on the 
and on their resume because the credentials 
have you know a little bit 
five six seven eight week old private looking at that yeah credentialed how we can partner with him bait you really marketable 
that's good yeah 
we we 
I think the role 
we we tried we can elevate a dated 
it's very hard 
a lot of help certain individual with a certain company or really have direct that road we have to take a fair approach where it okay well yeah any company 
yeah I really 
a okay well we have you know right now the largest auto company to take advantage of the 
program are doing you know soul related work because that really were a lot of that jobs are the company that though we try to keep it not open with the idea that over time your copy there are sprouting up we're going to turn to this program to help you on your people trained people and I'm not going to you know provide good experience for students 
I do it so they could either stay in that company or go to a different company though I didn't eat right 
necessarily them going in and actually getting a job out of it or out going into the internship getting experience 
to figure out well today I want you 
like this technology or that type of work something out 
well job can result to really have to get it out of the program we 
okay okay would make sure that people are getting the experience because our 
it is your number one 
are you going to do that we have our players that you know what they're looking for is that people are trying to hire they can't buy people with sufficient level 
and that's the on demand roadblock at so the internship program really it he 
lotus specific way we care cry to get that problem 
I yelled pool individual that had experience of that well whatever color 
they actually came don't have the latest technology work or just after and that much rushing in your car that you ought work 
you're not that great helping 
yeah that makes sense 
so you you mentioned just not like the view that the employers give you free of your programs %HESITATION 
what what would you guys say to the importers like what what what would you like to see more from from the market or from unions that you are collaborating with or that are applying we're putting out postings on on your program like what would would make things easier from your guys side 
yeah 
I think 
so I get talking a lot of that 
really it's also about you know the students are the people who are looking for the job I think right now you know we need to help her 
that population of individuals who are in a trade 
%HESITATION and either need to be aware that the opportunity out there and make those higher than where where 
back 
yeah there are out there really that he the one the biggest 
all that would target press right now is focusing on trying to solve that problem and try to make that happen 
first I take it to say that out 
really like maybe one focused on is 
one thing that would tell her that 
Wallace Porter for 
you know individual that certification or 
Michael experience one the most important aspect of a worker in their mind is simply that the individual had the ability to learn 
not necessarily mean you have to come 
a lot of technical skills but if they can learn on the job that you skill that's extremely important happening all day date what 
yeah provide individuals with the opportunity to provide that what the ability to try out different 
I should work log job 
our marketing 
pertain to try operations or try limit either at all they're doing that they can become a more well rounded 
and they're thinking especially their engineer 
it is very much there that they might be or stock your 
yeah yeah yeah came to 
tell people all the 
more frustrating opportunity in that can really help them become more well rounded which ultimately would make better employee for that company or in a better 
more competitive on the market what 
the player yes the external sensors night commission that would probably challenging for them because you said most of the companies that are presenting this program for small businesses less than ten people so 
maybe having someone be a little more dynamic would be good for that it might be difficult if they have constraints for we want someone for the specific role because we have a limited budget 
yeah yeah exactly 
it is only two three four people or they need somebody actually 
it all the time at school because it gives eternal 
yeah well what type of work I like what it worked I definitely not one of my life 
at the same time I'm getting paid for it and making connections strain that a winner for everyone yeah unit makes less sense 
excellent jazz it kind of information and so I guess taking a step back from the specifics of the programs 
one of the things that I've been trying to sort of peace out and again I think a big part of why this is difficult for me to understand is because work forces on it's new to me and I don't I'm not fully aware of all the history all policy 
it seems like you know this is this big green jobs movement came out of the bomb the stimulus you know two thousand nine two thousand ten to eleven 
in a lot of funding was directed at energy efficiency and weatherization and a big part of the rhetoric at least from my understanding and please get me wrong was in this notion of like green truck collar jobs or being able to 
take jobs that are environmentally friendly and use them as a source scalable solution to poverty alleviation %HESITATION so it seems like a lot people were really really excited about that there was a lot of 
jobs initiatives you know like skill works at a green jobs initiative I saw that was like the 
metro Boston green jobs coalition is a lot of different organizations sprung up around this time flow 
and the and the friendship all funding that became available on it seems like after the funding disappear in two thousand eleven that all these organizations either just disappear entirely or the conversation sort of shifted away from 
yeah you're creating positions that serve the tool need a %HESITATION connotation as well as party levy Asian it seems like it sort of shifted more towards 
can we just take these industries that are emerging and sort of run with it as a way to create jobs with the environmental benefits sort of just being you know something it's nice as in addition %HESITATION 
because I was I just want to respond a lot with that gyms in here somewhere you guys perceptions like you know what do you think we would have you seen in the past few years like it does that seem sort true I just said and that the conversation is more about can be discreet stable economy 
recession and less about environmental gestures are considerations or do you think that those underlying values there's this notion stand bill you're still really important %HESITATION to employers but also to state government 
we're going to see more of just we need to find a way to transition our economy to something that is is going to be more stable longer 
yeah everything and actually yeah you know now that she has an ability plan you know especially if you look at %HESITATION show we 
right now and 
you know the government binding legislation last year 
you know and a lot that will be you know actual are and also 
you know eight that mandate around an ability and you know really starting with governor Patrick creating that he'd be back in two thousand eight and then you know our current government kind of carrying that right now I think that it's a little bit of everything what you mentioned I think probably 
that 
because it was around the age at which I think they had just stopped there they were really thinking are thinking okay a hot topic right now so you know what you're saying but they weren't really thinking about the future 
I think what you know whether it nation back you know ten years ago was that you know they were taking 
what is that 
economically but in the very high cost of living 
the people were making fourteen dollars an hour you know I go back you know they were getting into the training more than a little of that and then they were making fourteen dollars hour and to you know go in one basement or attic or wall you know blowing it collation and or you know peeking out you don't handle rock how what you know that our and they were like well I really don't stop and shop 
all by street water right there good bad or I could be at McDonalds or I could just really all public 
and I have 
think that 
they really think about it wasn't really an action plan on okay you know you get in your car and you get happy wide to come back or there was a little bit around that any kind of but that would you know that was a lot 
there are you know kind of natural weight 
you know it you all that kind of being in your business looking great coaching for whatever it was 
you know what kind of future that you you want to really watching down our our job and the like you know the next year that I don't think that it would be good training for quick enough or they thought okay 
it could be in that program you know you're right you whatever nation 
they need a lot more 
back at 
she will come from there and there 
it brought out because it was like the government gave the government wanted the increased wait and if you look at what 
all right where they want it you can you know what they want to be an increase wage 
how are 
can't buy a year later they were making out with our like gallery basketball 
what really 
now that our 
about buying that 
however I think that yeah I think a lot of active about future plans and I think that what we do not operate it now we really think of a future plan you know why it was white yes yeah training and 
you know with a community college but then you got a in this job for 
so that you are now wait get a job at the we a little bit higher definitely that we got out you know it's hard white it would hardly little each so you know we have got about that that 
expected to act a little bit more than what I mean 
are working they have been training and hope that they would get that job 
so I think that that really 
got you know five years from now you really want to be doing acting job working out well 
you know 
wait out the really practical 
even though the only 
are you know grow daily about 
yeah 
wait that they can't be without 
I think they were that age and I think we're creating 
right now because it will now be working what gonna happen here 
I think people 
makes less sense 
and like that you know people die if you don't die in it you don't have a vision and really you know think about that 
for a moment you are not training you know we are working to ensure court and saying how do you know 
what they want second day air only 
date because they knew what people up or we don't think of work in the future 
makes sense 
okay yeah as in like a just continuing off that those those are great thank you %HESITATION 
one thing that I've seen as 
in some of the press releases I've read over the past like two or three years is 
does the phrase like I I don't I don't personally think this phrase is terribly important anymore but we think like the phrase green jobs I think it has a lot of meaning right like it can mean anything that helps support the environment you know this I can be a job that is a stable construction job could be something it's clean energy can be something urban agriculture like the the Boston mayors office 
urban %HESITATION farming things urban farming pathways ribbon athletes farming mission of 
two thousand sixteen %HESITATION putting out risk youth in us is like urban agriculture program they they specifically use that phrase green jobs which I thought was curious 
this is year two thousand sixteen it's almost a decade passed up on the stimulus to when you guys hear that phrase green jobs like the calendar about for this call today was was green job growth 
really Connie green workforce development like what it what exactly does that does that actually mean to you guys 
yeah I think what what I legislation 
you know it definition of green jobs 
you know green jobs we always get it right 
right 
so why what definition it but it does 
a little different 
I I think yeah got only about a little more 
it's like you know there's certainly 
job out there 
but according a lot of those are not the energy 
create better we really ought to make sure they were 
drawing a little bit okay yeah we have to focus on the clean energy 
but we can't we can't provide funding to probing L. plant treating your neighbors 
it's just like 
right shade and you know 
about residential electricity bills 
well that may be true but really it is that clean energy now yeah we have to really okay got what our mandate and although there are plenty of great job out there that might not be 
what we would consider you know there's there's a lot 
a lot we don't handle a lot of 
really it comes down to eat 
well 
yeah 
your education 
he 
our water technology radiation 
but you know generally what we 
yeah 
the ThinkCentre those busy when I figures like it because of the organization you work for that has to kind of be the definition of the approach you take %HESITATION exactly incorrectly from wrong like it sounds like 
personally you guys think that the definition of green jobs could be a little more inclusive of other things but because of 
again where you work it has to be sort of focus on clean energy and energy efficiency 
yeah I think that it out 
wide world out there different job that Daniel green for us we have to we have to be a little more filter on it 
yeah well being 
the diet 
the goal of growing anti jobs just to make sure there were things that yeah Ludmilla makes makes a hundred percent sounds cool well I don't think that I I have anymore 
specific questions for like what you guys you know during that day or I'm with these initiatives that and just have a couple of general questions 
as we wrap up 
you're the first one was is there is there anyone on that you guys think would be helped me to talk to other organizations reach out to you know as I just can't collect data 
for my thesis 
sure 
along comes to mind tied him as Kevin Doyle 
a lot 
the northeast clean energy Khalkhal which is a nonprofit 
they operated by the one he 
I would make a good impression is that going but you get a lower price work related 
as well there are there issues but I think he's a good person either 
where 
I guess what 
please try the bass and the workforce 
yeah yeah I'm basically looking at how we're for sellers of all in the Boston measures not past decade specifically how it aligning with Marvel gestures posed a are a so yes and workforce development is is the focus with the environmental considerations as like a side part 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah later in the will out 
minister minister 
what 
yeah the bigger 
yeah 
anyone else think that's pretty much the go to guy that would make most sense 
one customer by joining our you know our yeah and out of work for you would be yeah 
if you look at it 
each of your research 
you'll find it you'll find it website 
well Greenville George 
yeah I guess awesome awesome thank you very much 
yeah this last question Jim talking about some of these initiatives I was wondering would be possible if there's a channel I'm supposed to go through to request a little more specifically quantitative data on the programs like how many people graduated you know completion rate job placement rate demographics average wage job retention rate distinct things of that nature so it kind of look at you know what it's come out and and how the program is structured is somewhat we talk about 
correct you have an internship or infer the learn and earn enough that if there's specific measures for that but just yet sort of like what metrics of success are you guys keeping on record for for these programs 
yeah I think that we have done what I think publish 
I'll send you share 
yeah 
to go online and look up all your request 
right information and I will have huge data we can tell you like the internship program probably learning 
not a whole lot like job placement 
later that day and yet so if you ask about you know internship program that could be something that we yeah yeah 
yeah yeah I'm not looking for you know very very granular just something sort of broad overarching summer it would be great 
okay awesome solo all do that %HESITATION yes I don't think I have any more questions %HESITATION I really appreciate you guys taking time to talk to me I know you're probably very busy especially with the the new year coming about %HESITATION 
and I hope this is a problem for you guys it was for me 
yeah yeah I think you have 
yeah alliance and can really appreciate it 
all follow up if I have any other questions I guess and %HESITATION otherwise it would be guys have a great day 
if you want
